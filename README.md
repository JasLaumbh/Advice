## 🌐 Tech Stack

- **React.js** – Frontend framework for building UI.
- **JavaScript (ES6+)** – Core scripting language.
- **Advice Slip API** – Third-party API to fetch advice.

## ⚙️ How It Works

- The app loads with a random piece of advice from the Advice Slip JSON API.

- Clicking the “Give Me Advice” button sends a new GET request to the API.
  
- The returned advice is parsed and rendered dynamically on the page.
  
- The UI updates without reloading the page (thanks to React’s state handling).
